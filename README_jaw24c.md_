# jaw24c_MyFirstRepo_
I had already done work on Gitlab during my summer internship in data science, and Github is not too different. However, this lab taught me how to clone repositories and create my own new repository. I was also very new to some of the features on Github, like forks and pull requests. The readme file was very helpful for learning the basics of Github and what every different function does. During my internship, I was mainly focused on just creating code within Gitlab and I did not do many other things, so this tutorial was a great way for me to learn how to navigate Github. 
I am still struggling with remembering all of the commands, such as initializing repositories and adding changes to files. However, because of my experience with Gitlab, I did not struggle too much with this exercise.
